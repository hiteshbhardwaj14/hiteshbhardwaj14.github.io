    # description: Sep 2019 ‑ Current <br>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore <br>
    # PhD research majorly focused on nature inspired drones, in particular ’Monocopters’ which are inspired from naturally occurring Samara seeds
    # (Maple seeds), which have the ability to auto‑rotate in free fall
    # The research involves design, development, coding and experimentation phase for each project
    # Developing non‑linear controllers for multi‑actuator variants of Monocopter which can achieve a full 6 degree of freedom flight by entering into
    # second flight mode

    #   alt: SUTD
    # description: Oct 2014 ‑ Jul 2017 <br> Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy <br>
    # Graduated with overall score 88/110 (≡ 80/100)
    # Majors - Modelling and Simulation, Flight dynamics and control, Estimation in Aerospace, Propulsion, Management of Aerospace projects
    # Dissertation - “Design of sliding mode control techniques for rendezvous orbital maneuvers”
    # The thesis was based on design of the guidance and control system for an automated orbital maneuver performed by a chaser spacecraft to
    # achieve a space rendezvous with a target vehicle. A 6‑degree of freedom simulator was designed to implement adaptive 1st and 2nd order
    # sliding mode controllers, and a non‑linear dynamic system for the spacecraft that could be susceptible to various disturbances. The simulation
    # was performed using Matlab and Simulink software.

    # description: Sep 2011 ‑ Jun 2014 <br> University of the West of England, Bristol, UK <br>
    # Graduated with a First Class Honours’ Degree (≡ 78/100)
    # Majors - Aerodynamics, Flight control and simulation, Flight mechanics
    # Dissertation - “Design and implementation of a guidance algorithm for a UAAV”
    # The thesis developed concerned with designing a guidance algorithm for an autonomous UAV. The algorithm was based on ‘vector field path
    # following’ which took in as input the geodetic datum and gave the Heading angle and Vertical Flightpath angle as output. Preliminary 
    # simulations were run on Matlab and Simulink, and subsequently an implementation to an FPGA board was attempted. Coding in C and Java was
    # done to implement the code on FPGA board and a smartphone respectively.
