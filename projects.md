## 1. Asynchronous Multi-actuator Monocopter
Monocopters are single-wing rotorcrafts that are inspired by naturally occurring Maple seeds (_helicopter seeds_). Typically monocopters use two actuators to achieve flight and control, a thrust unit and a flap. The main purpose of this project is to implement additional actuators to investigate the he agility and maneuverability of the platform, which depends largely on the number of actuators, among other parameters. This project investigates the flight response of a dual motor + flap configuration monocopter, based on variation of the control signal allocated to the motors. Different scenarios are considered where the step response, waypoint tracking and trajectory tracking are compared for the different cases of control allocations considered.

## 2. Two Flight Mode Capable Single Wing Rotorcraft

Monocopters are single-wing, rotating aerial vehicles that fly by spinning their entire body. Meanwhile, bicopters are twin propeller-based aerial vehicles that control their attitude by changing the direction of thrust from the motors using two servos. In this project, a novel single-wing aerial vehicle, which can fly in both the monocopter and bicopter modes has been developed. To enhance its maneuverability while still being in the air, the platform can perform a mid-air transition from one mode to another. To achieve this, the attributes of monocopter and bicopter are fused, while allowing the monocopter to maintain its natural shape for flight. Considering forces and torques experienced by both modes of flight, the dynamics are described, and a cascaded control strategy is developed. A novel approach is proposed to control the angular velocity of the monocopter. An innovative blending and transition method of controllers for both modes is developed to allow transition between the two modes.

The results verify the proposed concept for the design of the aerial vehicle, along with the control strategy implemented for the control over the states during the flight modes as well as the transition between the two modes.
